*MoreModbus RELEASE NOTES**
---------------------------------------

*Wolkabout Technology s.r.o.*

Additional Modbus abstraction layer, parsing data from uint16_t registers into more useful types.

**Version 0.5.1**
    - [FEATURE] - Added the `forceReadOfMapping` method to the `ModbusReader`.

**Version 0.5.0**
    - [FEATURE] - Added the `autoLocalUpdate` parameter to mappings and changed the default behavior of mapping updates.

**Version 0.4.2**
    - [IMPROVEMENT] - Now using `WolkSDK-Cpp v3.2.1`.

**Version 0.4.1**
    - [IMPROVEMENT] - Renamed the `getValue` methods for the mappings.
    - [IMPROVEMENT] - Made `WolkSDK-Cpp` a submodule of the project, instead of an ExternalProject.

**Version 0.4.0**
    - [IMPROVEMENT] - Made the project use external dependencies instead of using submodules.
    - [IMPROVEMENT] - Reworked the entire CMake to be more inline with modern projects.
    - [IMPROVEMENT] - Added the compatibility for the logging to be delegated to some other logger.
    - [IMPROVEMENT] - Added big endian/little endian strings.
    - [BUGFIX] - Fixed the handling of single device connections to not give up on them, and try to use them again.
    - [BUGFIX] - Various smaller fixes in reading of registers.

**Version 0.3.2** - Added `repeat` and `defaultValue`
    - [IMPROVEMENT] - The mappings now have `repeat` and `defaultValue` parameters. These allow a mapping to be written every `repeat` milliseconds, even if it hasn't been changed externally.

**Version 0.3.1** - Fixed strings
    - [BUGFIX] - Fixed all strings to be read without a bunch of null characters. All null characters are replaced by empty strings, inbound or outbound.

**Version 0.3.0** - Included WolkSDK-Cpp/WolkAboutCoreUtilities
- [IMPROVEMENT] - Removed source for loggers and started using WolkSDK-Cpp for logging.

**Version 0.2.1** - Bugfixes
- [BUGFIX] - Fixed value limits, where slaveAddress is now int16_t instead of int8_t, and starting address of mapping is int32_t instead of int16_t.

**Version 0.2.0** - Unit Tests
- [FEATURE] Unit Tests - added a big suite of unit tests, meant to test flow of classes and workings of entire library. Implemented using google test library.
- [IMPROVEMENT] Renamed some members inside parsing functions for endians, where naming isn't non-consistent anymore
- [BUGFIX] Replaced circular pointers in some classes, where ones are now weak.
- [BUGFIX] Fixed device reading threads, so that they actually stop working when the main thread also stops.
- [BUGFIX] Fixed some checks while adding BitMappings in group, where group would before allow bit mapping to take claim of bit even if any other already claims it.

**Version 0.1.0** - Initial Release
- [BRIEF] MoreModbus allows users to created devices/readers with mappings, that will parse data incoming from Modbus into other types.
- [FEATURE] Mappings - single user understandable units, resulting in a single value of desired type, which occupies single/multiple Modbus registers.
- [FEATURE] Groups - multiple mappings being grouped for purpose of quicker reading, since a single Modbus instruction could be used to receive data for all mappings. Data separation/aggregation/parsing is done by the library.
- [FEATURE] Devices - cluster of mappings/groups meant for a single slave address, also captures status of slave, and captures data change event.
- [FEATURE] Reader - works with devices to read them periodically, and also handles data write requests.
